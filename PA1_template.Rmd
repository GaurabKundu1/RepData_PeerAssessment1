## Loading and preprocessing the data

It is required that data source file is already in a working directory. I check if the source file is unzipped and if it is not - I unzip it and load the data. Then I delete NA observations, since I do not need it for calculations.

```{r}
if (!file.exists("activity.csv") ) {
        unzip("activity.zip")
}
raw_data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
main_data <- na.omit(raw_data)
```

Then I explore the data with functions ‘str’, ‘head’, ‘tail’, ‘table’ (for each column) in order to get aquianted with it.
